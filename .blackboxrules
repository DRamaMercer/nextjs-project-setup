# Blackbox AI Coding and Integrity Rules

# 1. Code Quality and Standards
- Enforce ESLint and Prettier configurations across all packages and apps.
- All code must pass linting and formatting checks before merging.
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking enabled.

# 2. Branching and Code Review
- Use feature branches for all new work.
- Require pull requests with at least one approving review.
- No direct commits to main or production branches.

# 3. Testing
- Write unit tests for all new components and functions.
- Write integration tests for critical workflows.
- Use E2E tests for user-facing features.
- All tests must pass in CI before merging.

# 4. Modular Architecture
- Keep shared UI components and utilities in /packages.
- Avoid duplication by reusing shared packages.
- Follow separation of concerns and single responsibility principles.

# 5. Documentation
- Document all public APIs, components, and utilities.
- Maintain up-to-date README files for each package/app.
- Include usage examples and expected behaviors.

# 6. Dependency Management
- Use automated tools to keep dependencies up to date.
- Regularly audit for security vulnerabilities.

# 7. Security and Secrets
- Use environment variables for all secrets and sensitive data.
- Do not commit secrets or credentials to the repository.
- Implement role-based access control and RLS policies.

# 8. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement consistent logging across backend and frontend.
- Integrate error tracking (e.g., Sentry) for production monitoring.

# 9. Refactoring and Maintenance
- Schedule regular codebase reviews and refactoring sprints.
- Address technical debt promptly.

# 10. CI/CD
- Automate linting, testing, and deployment pipelines.
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts and testing in production.

# 11. Performance
- Optimize database queries and API responses.
- Monitor and improve frontend performance metrics.

# 12. Collaboration
- Communicate changes clearly in PR descriptions.
- Use issue tracking for task management and prioritization.
